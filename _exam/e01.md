## Instructions for the exam (please note that instructions for miderm 2 are different from midterm 1)

* You may bring one 8.5" x 11" piece of paper with notes on both sides. This paper will be collected along with your exam, so make your own copy if you would like to keep it.
* You may add your notes to this [COLLABORATIVE DOCUMENT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FY4WxNp9Vdc9jtEhCSRUVSeLgF4MjjHQaQuaMg7rQP4/edit?usp=sharing).
* No calculators or phones are allowed in the exam  
* There are no makeups for this exam
* You must write your name on every single sheet of paper including your notes
* We will provide you with scratch paper
* We will provide you the table of operator precedence
* The format of the exam will be similar to midterm 1
* Seating will be assigned - please check on Piazza

* Consolidated [exam notes](
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SyE8iRpH-haLS06KGHZdZaOniGsh9V0lG8vfpStX43Y/edit?usp=sharing
 ) These cover some of the topics. Add to them to personalize your notes to bring to the exam.

## Reference material
You are expected to know the material from the following lectures, labs and homeworks. Please be sure to review the code from lecture which can be found in the lecture notes (different from lecture slides)

## Post Midterm material

## Code written in lecture
[https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-w18/cs16-w18-lectures](https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-w18/cs16-w18-lectures)
* Lecture 1 to lecture 11
* Homeworks 1 to 10
* Labs 0 to 5

## Pracice problems: 

For topics on lectures 1-8, use the following practice problems. Please solve the problems on your own and don't just refer to the provided solutions:

* [Practice Problems -I](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-hpeFpfTvdcvNeTgvdJpWsLrkXrpdrq4-ZA1Dg7fC6w/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Solutions to the practice problems -I](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ezZK5Xh2zax86bvSy2o9gaNp2bPWDMLDwJX0oP_SGoQ/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Concept Inventory on Pointers and Arrays](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1z9k2M7uTvJaE9rR0F0OVV5ZWs?usp=sharing). 

We recommend that you try these problems after you have studied/contributed to the collaborative notes (see above) and gone through the labs, homeworks and lectures.


## Midterm Study Guide

* Write the skeleton of a simple C++ program - see the hello world example covered in lecture
* Write code that involves passing parameters to main
* Read and write to standard input, output with cin, cout - you should be able to write code that uses these concepts, identify the difference between cout, exit and return 
* Simple unix commands (covered in labs): cp, mkdir, ls, pwd, cd
* An understanding of what compilers are, the compilation and execution process of C++ programs: 
	* What is g++? What are the inputs and outputs ?
	* What is the difference between compiling and running a C++ program?
	* How can you ask g++ to use the c++11 libraries when compiling your C++ program
	* What are compile-time errors?
	* What are run-time errors?

* How to pass arguments to main refer to labs that used this concept

* While loops, for loops, do while loops (very important)

* Functions
  * An understanding of how parameters are passed to functions, and how values are returned from a function
  * Difference between function that prints to output and function that returns a value
  * Function declaration, definition and call
  * Writing functions similar to those in the labs

* The ability to use variables and basic data types in the type of programs covered in class:
	* Identify valid and invalid ways to name variables in C++ - Please refer to book on this
	* Identify invalid use of variables: For example using a variable in an expression or assignment before declaring it
	* Different ways of initializing variable: 
		```
			int x =10; int x(10); cin>>x;
		```
	* Difference between variable declaration and initialization.
	* What is the default value given to uninitialized variables in C++ and why this can be a problem

* The ability to debug and write code that involves flow control structures taught in class and used in labs. Pay attention to syntax, and the ability to use each appropriately to solve problems similar to those provided in the labs
	* If else statements, multiway if-else statements
	* For, while and do-while loops, nested for loops (used in lab02)
	* Identify the occurrence of infinite loops

* Memory
    * Basic model of memory (addressable bytes)
    * Representing multi-byte data like ints, address of multi-byte variables
    * Program layout in memory during runtime
    * Interaction of programs with memory (run-time stack vs. heap) (general theme in all the following topics, almost every lecture talks about this)

* Data representation:
    * Conversions between difference bases using positional encoding (hex decimal binary)
    * Finding the range of values with fixed numbers of bits for unsigned representation

* Arrays: [hw 08](/hwk/h08/),  [lab 04](/lab/lab04/), [lec 08](/lectures/lect08/), [lec 09](/lectures/lect09/), [lec11](/lectures/lect11/)
    * declaration [lec 08](/lectures/lect08/)
    * initialization [lec 08](/lectures/lect08/)
