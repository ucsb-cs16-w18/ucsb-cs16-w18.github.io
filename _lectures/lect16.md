# Topics

* Thinking recursively about problems on sequences
* Recursion vs. iteration via examples: printing elements of an array in order and in reverse order, printing elements of a linked-list in order and in reverse order
* How do we know our recursive solution is correct? Proof by induction
* Is recursive better than iterative?
* Problems that have a naturally recursive solution
* Under the hood of recursive functions (how recursive functions use the stack)
* Helper functions
* Recursion on strings
* Linked-list problems - freeing all nodes in a linked-list


* Deleting a single node in the linked-list (recursive)
* Deleting all nodes in the linked-list (highlight issues with dynamic memory management)
